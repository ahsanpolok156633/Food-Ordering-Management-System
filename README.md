# Food-Ordering-Management-System
We propose a “Food Ordering and Management System” for the above mentioned problem. In the current situation, this type of system has not been activated. So we think “Food Ordering and Management System” will benefit many restaurant. 
• Our system allow customers to place orders from their table which automatically gets sent to the kitchen without the need for waiters 
• Customers can view their outstanding bill with the touch of a button. 
• Customers can pay their bills sitting in the seats. 
• Customers can customize menu as they wants. 
• Customers can see their order’s live status. 
• Admin can monitor every order and track of business.  
• From the kitchen available orders and raw materials notification and chef approval will help to manage restaurant. 
• This application will work as more than a waiter and will reduce the cost of hiring the waiter.
